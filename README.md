# Node.js Pant Object

This is a little Command line app I did to help me learn Node.js and practice Prototypal Inheritance. It was a good exercise in using high order functions as well.  

1. Create a plant that is an object.
2. It starts out a seed.
3. When you pour water onto it, the seed becomes a plant the first time it is watered and grows two inches every watering after.
4. If you feed it plant food it grows one inch.
5. If you feed it anti-freeze it dies.
6. It's max height is 12 inches.
7. It cannot be fed more than 4 times or watered more than 4 times.
8. If you put it in the sun it flowers.
9. If you take it out of the sun the flower goes away.
